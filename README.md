# world_time_app

Hey there,
This is the world time zone app, it helps the users to see the time in different countries.

What did I use to build this application? 

I used Flutter in making this project and I integrated the timezone API using this website which provided for me the timezoneAPI (https://app.abstractapi.com/api)
(You can use android studio or visual Studio code IDE I personally
used android studio)

Description of the app:
I used 4 pages:
=>You will find them in the lib folder
*main.dart 
*home.dart
*loading.dart
*choose_location.dart 
I used 2 packages:
*services that contains the world time class(in the lib folder)
*assets that contains all the pics on the app

In This project I used stateful widgets, asynchronous functions, I integrated an
API, I applied the routing and mapping between the different pages.

Finally, If you are a beginner in flutter I highly recommend for you this
amazing Youtube channel (The Net Ninja) which helped me to learn flutter and build this app.

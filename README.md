# world_time_app

Hey there,
This is the world time zone app, it helps the users to see the time in different countries.

# What did I use to build this application? 

I used Flutter in making this project and I integrated the timezone API using this website which provided for me the timezoneAPI (https://app.abstractapi.com/api)
(You can use android studio or visual Studio code IDE I personally
used android studio)

# Description of the app:
I used 4 pages:<br/>
=>You will find them in the lib folder<br/>
Main.dart <br/>
Home.dart <br/>
Loading.dart <br/>
Choose_location.dart <br/>
I used 2 packages:<br/>
Services that contains the world time class(in the lib folder) <br/>
Assets that contains all the pics on the app <br/>

> In This project I used stateful widgets, asynchronous functions, I integrated an
API, I applied the routing and mapping between the different pages. <br/>

# Thank you.
